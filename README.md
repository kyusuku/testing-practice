# Testing Practice

Testing Practice is a project created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on **Test Driven Development (TDD)** using Jest to write unit tests for JavaScript functions. It aims to improve understanding of testing principles and ensure code reliability.

## Features

- âœ… **Unit Testing:** Write and run unit tests for JavaScript functions using Jest.
- ðŸ§ª **Test Driven Development:** Develop functions by writing tests first and implementing code to pass the tests.
- ðŸ“Š **Code Reliability:** Ensure the correctness of code through comprehensive test coverage.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Implements the functions to be tested.
- **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework used for writing and running tests.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built with the following objectives:

- ðŸ§ª **Test Driven Development:** Practice writing tests before implementing functionality.
- âœ… **Jest Framework:** Learn to use Jest for writing and running unit tests.
- ðŸ“Š **Code Quality:** Improve code reliability and maintainability through testing.

## Running the Tests Locally

To run the tests on your local computer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kyusuku/testing-practice.git
   cd testing-practice
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
